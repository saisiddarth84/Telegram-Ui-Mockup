# Telegram UI Clone with React

## Introduction

This project is a pixel-perfect replica of the Telegram messaging application, created for the assignment round for the position of Frontend React Developer at BeyondChats. The application has been built to closely mimic the UI/UX of the Telegram app in both desktop and mobile views using ReactJS and MUI (Material-UI). The application fetches chat and message data from provided API endpoints to display real-time data.

## Live Demo

## Conclusion

This project was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate my skills in ReactJS and UI/UX design. While the 48-hour time frame was a challenge, I strived to replicate the Telegram UI/UX as closely as possible and implement the necessary functionality using the provided API endpoints. I hope this submission meets your expectations.
